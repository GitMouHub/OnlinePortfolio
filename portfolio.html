      <h3>Loud and Soft, Video, 2019</h3>
      <p>This is a video art piece created from various recordings. This one in particular
was created from three recent clips the past month and three old clips from several
months ago. Together, they create the piece that represents need to find a quiet
place; away from the noise.</p>

    <h3>Clear Jelly, Composite, 2019</h3>
    <p>This is an composite art piece. I started with a simple image of jellyfish and
adjusted the colors’ tones to my liking. Then, I added another on top of the
modified jellyfish image. I reduced the visibility of the second image to make it
fade in with the jellyfish.</p>

    <h3>Not Android, Glitch, 2019</h3>
    <p>This is a glitch art piece done with some classmates. There were three of us, and
we were each assigned to create an exquisite cyborg that would be glitched. Once
the cyborg was completed, it was then taken into Audacity, where the image was
represented as a wave. That wave was adjusted to making the original image look
“glitched”, as it does here.</p>

    <h3>Free, Video Art, 2019</h3>
    <p>This is my final video project for my Art 74 class. I recorded areas where I like to hang out for my free time and stare into the sky. Along with the recordings are faded images that I took over the course of my third semester. And at the end of the video is a short animation of my two characters - Rokai and Calypse.</p>
